I particularly appreciate Vue's incorporation of reusable components, which greatly simplifies managing a bunch of code relatively new to me. 
Vanilla javascript can often bring a feeling of backtracking at times. Having Vue cover for me in aspects that might have eluded me in the past is a big help.
